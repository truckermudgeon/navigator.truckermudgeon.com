A temporary, Cloudflare-accessible repo to store the deployable files for my Navigator project. This repo will cease to exist once:
- the Navigator project is no longer in its _extremely_ experimental state
- I publish the Navigator code to https://github.com/truckermudgeon/maps
- I configure Cloudflare to build + deploy the Navigator project from https://github.com/truckermudgeon/maps
